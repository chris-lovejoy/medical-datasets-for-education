# High-Quality, Open-Source Medical Datasets for Education

This is a curated list of medical datasets best-suited to the purpose of learning and teeaching. It is not intended to be comprehensive list of all medical datasets. Rather the intention is to include data that has been vetted for both quality and ease of access (ie. open-source) and which are therefore well-suited to educational purposes.


## Principles of this repository
- Links to high-quality tutorials utilising the dataset will be included along with the dataset description, where such tutorials and walk-throughs are available. 
- Contributions are actively encouraged. Please submit a pull-request.
- This list exists in collaboration with [other lists of medical datasets](#other-lists-of-medical-datasets), which take different approaches and have different focusses.
