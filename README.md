# High-Quality, Open-Source Medical Datasets for Education

This is a curated list of medical datasets best-suited to the purpose of learning and teeaching. It is not intended to be comprehensive list of all medical datasets - rather, the intention is to include data that has been vetted for both **quality** and **ease-of-access** (ie. open-source) and which are therefore well-suited to educational purposes.


## Contents
- [Medical Images](#1-medical-images)
- [Text Data](#2-text-data)
- [Other Modalities and Multi-Modal](#3-other-modalities-and-multi-modal)
<!-- TODO: add sub-headings to the content index -->


## Principles of this repository
- Contributions are actively encouraged. Please [submit a pull request](https://github.com/chris-lovejoy/medical-datasets-for-education/pulls).
- Links to high-quality tutorials utilising the dataset will be included along with the dataset description, where such tutorials and walk-throughs are available. 
- This list exists in collaboration with [other lists of medical datasets](#other-lists-of-medical-datasets) which have different approaches and focusses.

# (1) Medical Images

### X-Rays

[CheXpert](https://stanfordmlgroup.github.io/competitions/chexpert/): 224,316 chest radiographs from 65,240 patients. Each report was labeled for the presence of 14 observations as positive, negative, or uncertain.



### CT

[The National CT Colonography Trial](https://wiki.cancerimagingarchive.net/pages/viewpage.action?pageId=3539213): 825 cases of CT colonography imaging with accompanying spreadsheets that provide polyp descriptions and their location within the colon segments.



### MRI

[fastMRI](https://fastmri.med.nyu.edu): Several thousand knee MRIs. Requires application for access (online form).



### Histology


TCGA: http://cancergenome.nih.gov/ https://tcga-data.nci.nih.gov/tcga/ 



### Other (Ultrasound, Retinal)

[EchoNet-Dynamic](https://echonet.github.io/dynamic/index.html): 10,030 echocardiogram videos.



# (2) Natural Language Data

### Clinical

[MIMIC-III](http://physionet.org/physiobank/database/mimic3cdb/): Anonymized critical care EHR database on 38,597 patients and 53,423 ICU admissions. Requires registration.



### Biomedical Research

[S2ORC: The Semantic Scholar Open Research Corpus](https://github.com/allenai/s2orc#download-instructions): 81.1M English-language academic papers spanning many academic disciplines.



# (3) Other Modalities and Multi-Modal

### Bioinformatics / Biospecimen

[The Cancer Genome Atlas Program](https://www.cancer.gov/about-nci/organization/ccg/research/structural-genomics/tcga): over 2.5 petabytes of genomic, epigenomic, transcriptomic, and proteomic data from over 20,000 primary cancer and matched normal samples spanning 33 cancer types.


### Time series

[Parkinson Speech Dataset](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Parkinson+Speech+Dataset+with++Multiple+Types+of+Sound+Recordings): 26 types of sound recordings taken from 20 Parkinson's patients and 20 health patients. 


### Subsections to potentially add:
- EHR-derived data
- public health / population health data
